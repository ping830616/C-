# C#

**C#** is one of the most popular programming languages used to develop software for the Microsoft platform. This is the language that is designed for both professionals and beginners. As for a beginner like me, I have been able to apply C# programming technique as a technical tool to navigate software on the platform of the famous IDE called Microsoft Visual Studio for the examination and the analysis of an image. And the main goal is to clear out the noise possibly shown on an image by image processing developed by C# with multiple methods and approaches. Therefore, that has been a great reward of being able to practically do image processing as a new learner so far.

Along with that, the coding for the relationship between PC and PLC is quite fascinating in terms of its complexity and logic. A diagram of the interaction with detailed explanation for each main box is displayed below. It is a helpful and easy step to learn about telecommunication or information technology for the first time in general by simply putting my effort to understand the data-transmitting communication between PC and PLC with the indispensable involvement of TCP and Communication Protocol in the expressing form of C#. Once the logic of telecommunication enriches my mind for the sake of learning experience on a practical level in light of its relevance to the society, I will have a rich concept on how to do coding in order to direct the data communication behind the whole show. 

The sequence for the great way to learn about C# in applicability:
        
        Fundemantals of C# --> Telecommunication between PC and PLC --> Camera and light source (optics) --> Machine Vision

Several applications of C# are listed below:
